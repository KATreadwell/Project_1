# Project_1

Description
Bored?  Hungry?!  No worries- we’ve got you!  In a world where you can’t go to a movie theater nor to your favorite restaurant, you can still use our “Dinner + Movie” app to get movie and recipe suggestions based on your entertainment preferences, dietary restrictions, and what you have in your fridge!

Motivation 
“Dinner _ Movie” app solves 3 pressing problems in coronavirus-ridden America: what to watch, what to eat, and how to cook what you want to eat.  

Results
Using a carefully-constructed form to gather user input and The Movie Database and Edamam APIs, we were able to create an app that:
1) returns appropriately-rated movies according to the user’s preferred genres and 
2) returns targeted recipes according to the user’s dietary restrictions, available cooking time, cuisine preference, and available food stuffs.

Individual Responsibilities
HTML and Javascript functions: Eliska!
CSS and implementation of Swiper (new tech): Andrew!
Recipe API “Edamam”: Jared!
Movie API “The Movie Database”: Kat!

Challenges 
1.  GitHub and managing updates
2.  Swiper.js
3.  Incorporating the back-end into the front-end

Next Release 
1.  Surprise Me!: give the option to the user to randomize movie and/or food options returned.
2.  To movie results returned, add which streaming service (e.g. Hulu, Netflix, etc) hosts the selected movie.
3.  Allow users to “favorite” recipes and movies and add to an easily-accessible page.
